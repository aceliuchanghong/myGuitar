[Verse 1]

C
When I get older losing my hair,
                G
Many years from now.
G
Will you still be sending me a Valentine.
                    C
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine.


[Verse 2]

C
If I'd been out till quarter to three.
C7                   F
Would you lock the door.
F              Fm       C              A
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
D        G7     C
When I'm sixty-four.

Am              E
You'll be older too,

And if you say the word,
F       G         C
I could stay with you.

C
I could be handy, mending a fuse
                        G
When your lights have gone.
G7
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
                C
Sunday morning, go for a ride,

Doing the garden, digging the weeds,
C7                 F
Who could ask for more.
F              Fm       C              A
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
D        G7    C
When I'm sixty-four.

Every summer we can rent a cottage,
G                      Am
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
Am                  E
We shall scrimp and save
Am               D7
Grandchildren on your knee
F     G         C
Vera, Chuck and Dave


[Verse 5]

C
Send me a postcard, drop me a line,
                G
Stating point of view.

Indicate precisely what you mean to say
                    C
Yours sincerely, Wasting Away.

Give me your answer, fill in a form
C7           F
Mine for evermore
F              Fm       C              A
Will you still need me, will you still feed me,
D7       G7    C
When I'm sixty-four?
