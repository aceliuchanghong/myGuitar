When I get older losing my hair

Many years from now

Will you still be sending me a valentine

Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?


If I'd been out till quarter to three

Would you lock the door

Will you still need me, will you still feed me

When I'm sixty-four?


You'll be older too

And if you say the word

I could stay with you


I could be handy mending a fuse

When your lights have gone

You can knit a sweater by the fireside

Sunday mornings go for a ride




Doing the garden, digging the ****s

Who could ask for more?


Will you still need me, will you still feed me

When I'm sixty-four?



Every summer we can rent a cottage

每个夏天，我们可以去租一个小屋

In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear

在怀特岛，假如不是太贵的话

We shall scrimp and save

我们应该省吃俭用

Grandchildren on your knee

孙子孙女们坐在你的膝盖上

Vera, Chuck, and Dave

Vera，Chuck和Dave



Send me a postcard, drop me a line

给我寄一张明信片，写一封信

Stating point of view

告诉我你的想法

Indicate precisely what you mean to say

直接地告诉我你想说的话

Yours sincerely, wasting away

省略掉“yours sincerely”



Give me your answer, fill in a form

给我你的答案，填满我的表格

Mine for evermore

我始终如一

Will you still need me, will you still feed me

你还会需要我吗，你还会照顾我吗

When I'm sixty-four?

在我六十四岁的时候



Whoo!
