[Intro]
Am     F
Hmm-mmm-mmm
G      Am
Hmm-mmm-mmm
Am     F
Hmm-mmm-mmm
G      Am
Hmm-mmm-mmm
Am
Hmm-mmm-mmm


[Verse 1]
Am                     F
I dream a hundred dreams a minute
G             Am
I'm deep inside what I construct
Am                   F
So there's no use don't even bother
G                   Am
Tonight is not the night for us


[Verse 2]
Am                    F
I have a million shapes a decade
G                    Am
I'm past the point of no return
Am                   F
So don't even call don't even bother
G                  Am
'Cause I can't make you my concern


[Pre-Chorus]
F                      C
I'm running faster than before
G
Beats and tunes and lovers
E
Cannot hold me back no more
F             C
I work alone
G             N.C.
Is this all I'll ever know?


[Chorus]
N.C                 Am
And I remember all my childhood dreams
F                           G
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
Am                     Am
And I remember all my childhood dreams
F                           G
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
Am
And I remember all my...


[Verse 3]
Am                      F
So as the night time hits my window
G                   Am
Sudden move to gain the lights
Am                     F
'Cause I'm not even close to done yet
G                      Am
No I won't leave I'm too inspired


[Verse 4]
Am                    F
And when the dawn emerges slowly
G                  Am
I realize the night is passed
Am                   F
The sounds I made were visionary
G               Am
Looking forward to go back


[Pre-Chorus]
F                      C
I'm running faster than before
G
Beats and tunes and lovers
E
Cannot hold me back no more
F             C
I work alone
G             N.C.
Is this all I'll ever know?


[Chorus]
N.C                 Am
And I remember all my childhood dreams
F                           G
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
Am                     Am
And I remember all my childhood dreams
F                           G
I find it hard to get them out of my mind
Am
And I remember all my...
Am     F
Hmm-mmm-mmm
G      Am
Hmm-mmm-mmm
Am     F
Hmm-mmm-mmm
G      Am
Hmm-mmm-mmm
Am
Hmm-mmm-mmm
