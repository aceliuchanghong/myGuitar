[Verse 1]
G           Em         C           D
There are places I'll remember
G          Em       Am
All my life, though some have changed
G      Bm        C          D
Some forever, not for better
G         Em       C        D
Some have gone and some remain

[Chorus]
C       D       G        Em
All these places had their moments
C         D         G        Em
With lovers and friends I still can recall
C         D       G        Em
Some are dead and some are living
C       D       G
In my life, I've loved them all

[Verse 2]
G          Em          C           D
But of all these friends and lovers
G          Em          Am
There is no one compares with you
G         Bm       C          D
And these memories lose their meaning
G           Em       C         D
When I think of love as something new

[Chorus]
C       D       G        Em
Though I know I'll never lose affection
C         D         G        Em
For people and things that went before
C         D       G        Em
I know I'll often stop and think about them
C       D       G
In my life, I love you more

[Chorus]
C       D       G        Em
Though I know I'll never lose affection
C         D         G        Em
For people and things that went before
C         D       G        Em
I know I'll often stop and think about them
C       D       G
In my life, I love you more

[Outro]
C       D       G
In my life, I love you more
