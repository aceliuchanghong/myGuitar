Capo=5

[Chorus]
               Dm
Let's fall in love for the night
        G                 Am
And forget in the morning
           Dm
Play me a song that you like
         G                    C
You can bet I'll know every line
      Dm                            G
I'm a boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
        C                               Am
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise
Dm           G         G7       C
I know better than to call you mine
 
 
[Verse 1]
                   Dm
You need a pick me up?
G                         Am
 I'll be there in twenty five
                    Dm
I like to push my luck
G                                C   E7
 So take my hand, let's take a drive
                        Dm     G
I've been living in the future
                        C    Am
Hoping I might see you sooner
          Dm
I want you, riding shotgun I knew
                 G  G7
When I got one right
 
 
[Chorus]
               Dm
Let's fall in love for the night
        G                 Am
And forget in the morning
           Dm
Play me a song that you like
         G                    C
You can bet I'll know every line
      Dm                            G
I'm a boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
        C                               Am
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise
Dm           G                    C
I know better than to call you mine
 
 
[Verse 2]
           Dm                          G
I love it when you talk that nerdy shit
                 Am                      Am
We're in our twenties talking thirties shit
               Dm                     G
We're making money but we're saving it
                          C                          E7
'Cause talking shit is cheap and we talk a lot of it
           Dm              G
You won't stay with me, I know
                       C                  Am
But you can have your way with me till you go
       Dm                                          G    G7
And before your kisses turn into bruises, I'm a warning
 
 
[Chorus]
               Dm
Let's fall in love for the night
        G                 Am
And forget in the morning
           Dm
Play me a song that you like
         G                    C   E7
You can bet I'll know every line
              Dm                            G
Cause I'm the boy that your boy hoped that you would avoid
        C                               Am
Don't waste your eyes on jealous guys, fuck that noise
Dm           G Dm           G  Dm           G                         Cmaj7
I know better, I know better, I know better than to ever call you mine
