D                                   C        G   D
I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me
D                                      C    G    D
She showed me her room, isn't it good, Norwegian wood

    Dm                                         G    ( G )
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
Dm                                           Em   A
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair

D                               C        G   D
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine
D                                       C         G   D
We talked until two, and then she said, it's time for bed

    Dm                                               G    ( G )
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
Dm                                                Em   A
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

D                              C         G   D
And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown
D                                C    G    D
So, I lit a fire, isn't it good, Norwegian wood
