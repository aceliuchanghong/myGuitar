D  G    A    F#m     Bm    G     A    Bm

G                            A
Lately I’ve been thinking ‘bout what I can do
F#m                          Bm
I’ve been stressing to fall back in love with you
G                    A                          Bm                      D
I’m so sorry that I couldn’t follow through but I can’t go on this way, I’ve gotta stop it babe
G                         A
You’ve been wonderful in all that you can be
F#m                   Bm
But it hurts when you say that you understand me
G              A              Bm
So believe me, I, I am sorry, I  … I am sorry, I, I -

CHORUS
G                A                     F#m                Bm
I wanted you to be there when I fall, I wanted you to see me through it all
G               A
I wanted you to be the one I loved
Bm            D
I wanted you, I wanted you
G            A                     F#m            Bm
I wanted you to hold me in my sleep, I wanted you to show me what I need
G                  A
I wanted you to know just how down deep
Bm             D
I wanted you, I wanted you

G                          A
I’ve been pushing hard to open up the door
F#m                        Bm
Trying to take us back to where we were before
G                          A                      Bm                        D
But I’m done, I just can’t do this anymore ‘cause we can’t be mended, so let’s stop pretending now
G                            A
We’ve been walking round in circles for some time
F#m                    Bm
And I think we should head for the finish line
G             A               Bm
So believe me, I, I am sorry, I  … I am sorry, I, I -   (CHORUS)

Bm
I, I, I’m so sorry baby
A
But I, I, I gotta pack up and leave
Bm                                    A
But I, I’ll always remember how we came close
G    A
To being what I wanted to be
Bm
I wanted you baby   
G   A         D
I…..I wanted you
