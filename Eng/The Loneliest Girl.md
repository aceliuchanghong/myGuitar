[Verse 1]

Em                 C            G
It's a little cold in paradise tonight
Bm
Love faded
Em                  C                  G
I’m finding new forms, I'll ride it out
Bm
It's fine for now
Em                  C         G
Then you come along and I cry
Bm
Liberated
Em                    C                     G
I’m seeing clearly now, there's no turning back
Bm
And I'm overwhelmed


[Pre-Chorus]

C                 G                     Em
Do you really want to set the night on fire?
D
You're my only way out
C                   G                 Em
Do you really want to turn your life around again?
D
You know you're my last chance


[Chorus]

C
Can you feel my..
G
Can you feel my..
Em              D
Can you feel my tears? They won't dry
C
Can you feel my..
G               Em         D      C
Can you feel my tear drops of the loneliest girl?
G
The loneliest girl


[Verse 2]

Em             C
Can you really love with a broken
G
heart
Bm
In the cold rain?
Em              C
I’m giving it a try, I’ll let it
G
fly
Bm
You can count me in
Em                C
So when the night falls, I’ll be
G
on your side
Bm
These eyes don’t lie
Em                 C
‘Cause my defeated heart’s got
G
nothing to hide
Bm
It’s my only vice


[Chorus]

C
Can you feel my..
G
Can you feel my..
Em              D
Can you feel my tears? They won't dry
C
Can you feel my..
G
Can you feel my..
Em              D
Can you feel my tears? They won't dry
C
Can you feel my..
G
Can you feel my..
Em              D
Can you feel my tears? They won't dry
C
Can you feel my..
G               Em         D      C
Can you feel my tear drops of the loneliest girl?
G
The loneliest girl


[Outro]

Em               C
Keep it, keep it close to your
G
heart
Bm
And it won’t go
Em               C
Keep it, keep it close and then
Em    D   C
you’ll start to grow
