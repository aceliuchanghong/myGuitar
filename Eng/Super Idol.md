[Verse 1]
C                       D
Super idol's biggest smile can't compare to you
Bm                     Em
You're everything I need. I hope you feel that too
C                      D
When you said "I do like you." I laughed
G                          G
Cause you are my favorite too

[Chorus]
C                       D
I don't buy "Love At First Sight"
Bm                     Em
But when I saw your face I said: "Damn, they're right."
C                       D
Hold on, this is really not my style
G                          G
But when you're scared at night I just wanna hold you tight

[Verse 2]
C                       D
Don't like crowds, that's really not our scene
Bm                     Em
And I know we both don't like jeans
C                D               G
Feels so nice, we are so alike, I think I'm into you

[Chorus]
C                       D
Super idol's biggest smile can't compare to you
Bm                     Em
You're everything I need. I hope you feel that too
C                      D
When you said "I do like you." I laughed
G                          G
Cause you are my favorite too

[Bridge]
C                       D
Super idol's biggest smile can't compare to you
Bm                     Em
You're everything I need. I hope you feel that too
C                      D
When you said "I do like you." I laughed
G                          G
Cause you are my favorite too
