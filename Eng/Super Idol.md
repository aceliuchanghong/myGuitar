Superidol's biggest smile can't compare to you

You're everything i need.I hope you feel that too

When you said "I do like you." I laughed

Cuz you are my favourite too

three, two, one, go

I don't buy "Love At First SIght"

But when i saw your face i said:"Damn,they're right."

Hold on this is really not my style

But when you're scared at night i just wanna hold you tight

Don't like crowds that's really not our scene

And i konw we both don't like jeans

Feel so nice we are so alike, I think I'm into you

Superidol's biggest smile can't compare to you

You're everything i need.I hope you feel that too

When you said "I do like you." I laughed

Cuz you are my favourite too

Superidol's biggest smile can't compare to you

You're everything i need.I hope you feel that too

When you said "I do like you." I laughed

Cuz you are my favourite too
