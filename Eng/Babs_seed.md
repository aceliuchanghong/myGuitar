[Intro]
C        Am
Y-yeah y-yeah y-yeah
Em       F
y-yeah y-yeah y-yeah
C        Am             G            F  G
y-yeah y-yeah y-yeah y-yeah y-yeah

[Verse 1]
C                 Am           Em           F
First we thought that Babs was so really really sweet
C            Am        Em                  F
A new friend to have and it seemed like such a treat
C          Am                  Em              Am
But then we found the truth: she's just a bully from the east
C               Am         G          F
She went from Babs, yeah, to a bully and a beast
Em                   F              G
Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead

[Chorus]
C        G            Am         F
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do?
C        G               Am         G
Got a bully on our tail, gotta hide, we gotta bail
C        G            Am         F
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you
C        G               Am          G
Gotta run, we gotta flee, gotta hurry don't you see?
Em                 F                 G        C
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad seed!

[Intro]
Am
Y-yeah y-yeah y-yeah
Em       F
y-yeah y-yeah y-yeah
C        Am             G            F  G
y-yeah y-yeah y-yeah y-yeah y-yeah

[Verse 2]
C           Am          Em        F
Hidin' from a bully, we know it isn't right
C          Am                   Em             F
But the Cutie Mark Crusaders, we aren't lookin' for a fight
C           Am                G               Am
Oh she'll go home soon and then we'll have some peace again
C      Am                   G          F
But for now we're staying out of her way 'til then
Em                   F              G
Everywhere we turn, she's just a step ahead

[Chorus]
C        G            Am         F
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, what we gonna do?
C        G               Am         G
Got a bully on our tail, gotta hide, we gotta bail
C        G            Am         F
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, if she's after you
C        G               Am           F
Gotta run, we gotta flee, gotta hurry, don't you see?

[Bridge]
G            Am
Why so mean? Why so crude?
Em           F
Why so angry? Why so rude?
C                  Em
Can't you be nice? Can't we be friends?
F                     G
Isn't it sad this is how it all ends?

[Chorus]
C        G           Am          F
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad
C        G           Am          F
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad
C          Am         G                           C
Babs Seed, Babs Seed, she's just a bad, bad seed!
