[Intro]
Am Am/G F#m7b5 Fmaj7
Am G D E

[Verse 1]
Am          Am/G         F#m7b5            Fmaj7
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
Am            G          D Dsus4 D Dsus2 D Esus4 E
While my guitar gently weeps
Am          Am/G         F#m7b5       Fmaj7
I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
Am            G          C     E
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Chorus 1]
A              C#m  F#m        C#m
I don't know why      nobody told you
Bm                   E Esus4 E
How to unfold your love
A              C#m  F#m            C#m
I don't know how      someone controlled you
Bm                     E Esus4 E
They bought and sold you

[Verse 2]
Am          Am/G         F#m7b5      Fmaj7
I look at the world, and I notice it's turning
Am            G          D Dsus4 D Dsus2 D Esus4 E
While my guitar gently weeps
Am       Am/G         F#m7b5    Fmaj7
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Am            G          C     E
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Intrumental]

Am G C E

[Chorus 2]
A              C#m  F#m            C#m
I don't know how      you were diverted
Bm                   E Esus4 E
You were perverted too
A              C#m  F#m            C#m
I don't know how      you were inverted
Bm               E Esus4 E
No one alerted you

[Verse 3]
Am          Am/G         F#m7b5            Fmaj7
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
Am            G          D Dsus4 D Dsus2 D Esus4 E
While my guitar gently weeps
Am          Am/G       F#m7b5       Fmaj7
Look at you all...
Am            G          C     E
Still my guitar gently weeps
