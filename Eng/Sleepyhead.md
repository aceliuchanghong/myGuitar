[Verse 1]


       F#m         D     E A
In the year of our Lord 1239

      F#m          D           E    F#m
There once lived a girl of the royal line

    F#m     D       E      A
The ancient stories do recall

F#m         D       E       F#m
She was the fairest of them all


F#m    D      E       A
In the castle made of stone

F#m   D          E     F#m
Every night she slept alone

F#m  D                E         A
Any noise that would raise the dead

F#m      D        E       F#m
Couldn't wake her sleepyhead

F#m D   E   F#m
Oh- oh- oh- oh


[Chorus]


F#m D   E   A
Oh- oh- oh- oh

F#m D   E   F#m
Oh- oh- oh- oh

F#m D   E   A
Oh- oh- oh- oh

F#m D   E   F#m
Oh- oh- oh- oh


[Verse 2]


F#m          D                  E  A
The stranger came from the foreign land

F#m    D       E        F#m
Asking for the maiden's hand

F#m        D         E  A
Her father said no go away

F#m         D          E      F#m
She's gonna marry a king one day


F#m                    E   A
The stranger he came back again

F#m   D         E        F#m
Riding with 10 thousand men

F#m        D             E       A
The battle cries filled all with dread

F#m          D        E      F#m
But couldn't wake her sleepyhead

F#m  D  E  F#m
Oh- oh- oh- oh


[Chorus]


F#m D   E   A
Oh- oh- oh- oh

F#m D   E  F#m
Oh- oh- oh-  oh

F#m D   E   A
Oh- oh- oh- oh

F#m D   E  F#m
Oh- oh- oh-  oh


[Verse 3]


F#m          D       E      A
The fighting lasted all day long

F#m            D            E        F#m
But the castle walls where thick and strong

F#m          D         E   A
The stranger cried let her decide

F#m      D      E          F#m
Where her true affections lie


F#m    D             E     A
So the king knocked on her door

F#m   D       E        F#m
Only you can end this war

F#m     D            E      A
No one knows how the story ends

F#m      D    E      F#m
Did she ever wake again?

F#m      D    E      F#m
Will she ever wake again?
