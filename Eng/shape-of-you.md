C#m F#m A B
C#m F#m A B

[Verse 1]
C#m                 F#m
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
A              B
So the bar is where I go (mm-mm-mm-mm)
C#m                      F#m
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
A                B
Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mm-mm-mm-mm)
C#m                       F#m
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
A                       B
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
C#m                    F#m
Take my hand, stop, put Van the man on the jukebox
A                B
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
C#m              F#m
Girl, you know I want your love
A                      B                 C#m
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
F#m
Come on now, follow my lead
A               B
I may be crazy, don't mind me, say
C#m            F#m
Boy, let's not talk too much
A                    B                C#m
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
F#m
Come on now, follow my lead
A*                     N.C.
Come-come on now, follow my lead, mm-mm-mm

[Chorus]
C#m      F#m                    A
I'm in love with the shape of you
B                  C#m
We push and pull like a magnet do
F#m              A
Although my heart is falling too
B                 C#m
I'm in love with your body
F#m                  A
And last night you were in my room
B                    C#m
And now my bedsheets smell like you
F#m                  A
Every day discovering something brand new
B                 C#m
Well, I'm in love with your body

          F#m       A           B               C#m
oh I oh I oh I oh I    I'm in love with your body
F#m       A           B               C#m
oh I oh I oh I oh I    I'm in love with your body
F#m       A           B               C#m
oh I oh I oh I oh I    I'm in love with your body
F#m                  A
Every day discovering something brand new
B
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2]
C#m                    F#m
One week in we let the story begin
A                B
We're going out on our first date
C#m                   F#m
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
A                   B
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
C#m                       F#m
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
A                B
And how your family is doin' okay
C#m             F#m
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
A                     B
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus]
C#m              F#m
Girl, you know I want your love
A                      B                 C#m
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

A                    B                C#m
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
F#m
Come on now, follow my lead
A*                     N.C.
Come-come on now, follow my lead, mm-mm-mm
