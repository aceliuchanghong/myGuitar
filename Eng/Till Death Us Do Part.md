C G D G

         C
What can I do?
        Cm
How can I show you
     C       G     
And let you see
           D
That I am someone
                 G
That you want me to be?
I'm only me
Not someone better
Not someone good
I'd be a soldier
That's if I only could
If I were king
I'd tell my army
To change the world
              D7
Then I'd be someone
Like you want me to be

In my little life
I know that the world must keep on turning
Even though it leaves me far behind
Life is like a school
But I'm not prepared to keep on learning
Even though it treats me like a fool


This is our lot
To live together
Not live apart
Let's stay together
Until death us do part
Not just a day
But 'til forever
Just as the stars
Just as the ending
Until death us do part
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la
