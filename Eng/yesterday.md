[Verse 1]
C        Bm7       E7                 Am       G F
Yesterday,  all my troubles seemed so far away
G                       C
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
C/B Am  D7       F     C
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Verse 2]
C       Bm7        E7             Am         G F
Suddenly,  I'm not half the man I used to be
G              C
There's a shadow hanging over me
C/B Am    D7       F     C
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
Bm  E7  Am  G  F           Dm6       G7       C
Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say
Bm E7   Am  G     F            Dm6      G7    C
I  said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
C        Bm7         E7           Am           G F
Yesterday,  love was such an easy game to play
G               C
Now I need a place to hide away
C/B Am  D7       F     C
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus]
Bm  E7  Am  G  F           Dm         G       C
Why she had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say
Bm E7   Am  G     F            Dm       G     C
I  said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

[Verse 4]
C        Bm7         E7           Am           G F
Yesterday,  love was such an easy game to play
G               C
Now I need a place to hide away
C/B Am  D7       F     C
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Am        D7      F      C
